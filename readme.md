Steps to handle git.

1. Main branch will always have up to date working code.
2. Always pull from main before you start working on a new feature/epic/story/task.
3. After pulling make a branch such as feature/SignIn, bugfix/Alerts etc....
4. start pushing code on your branch after making progress.
5. Once you are done, then contact others or let them know before merging.
6. If the files you have changed does not overlap with theirs, then it will be easy merge with main.
7. If latter then merging will be done sequentially one after the other with main.
